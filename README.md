Toward a philosophy of coding

## Working as groups
"The most effective, driven, and powerful development teams Iâ€™ve been part of spent much of their time designing, not programming. And we were designing as a team."

"Since designing a system is the most powerful way a team bonds, how do you engender that same feeling in new hires, even after a system has been designed? You must explain to new hires why a system works a certain way, not just how. Describe how the design evolved in the past, the decisions that were made, and wrong paths that were chosen." (untested by us, so far)

Keep project-core teams as small as possible because of Brook's Law (communication costs scale as _N_ (_N_+1)/2 where _N_ is the number of programmers). See [Eric S. Raymond's "The Cathedral and the Bazaar".](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s05.html)

"Given the right ingredients, a good team will self-organize [...]. The only thing that imposing a methodology on a team does, in the best case, is remove some of the time/effort that it would take the team to cohere and find a stable state around their own set of processes, built up from first principles; it eliminates a sort of wheel-reinvention, but at the cost of possibly not discovering anything better for that specific project or problem space." - https://www.metafilter.com/182719/The-End-of-Agile#7770311

## Metaphilosophy
_Nullius in verba_: We endeavor to not take anybody else's word on how things should be done. The quotes above have been chosen since they back up and describe our own experience, except where noted.
